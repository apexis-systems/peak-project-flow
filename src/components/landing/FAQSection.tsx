    q: "Who is Apexis for?",
    a: "Apexis is built for architects, interior designers, contractors, builders, and real estate developers who manage construction and design projects and need structured reporting and client communication.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does this replace project management tools?",
    a: "Apexis complements your existing project management tools. We focus specifically on site documentation, structured reporting, and controlled client visibility — the execution layer that most project management tools miss.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is my data secure?",
    a: "Absolutely. All data is encrypted at rest and in transit. We implement role-based access controls and enterprise-grade security protocols. Your project data never leaves your control.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this suitable for small firms?",
    a: "Yes. Our Starter plan is designed for up to 5 projects. Whether you're a solo architect or a growing firm, Apexis scales with your needs.",
  },
  {
    q: "When is the full launch?",
    a: "We are currently onboarding select pilot firms in our private beta. Full launch is planned for later this year. Join early access to secure founding member benefits.",
