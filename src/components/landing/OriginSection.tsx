              APEXIS was born out of years of real-world experience in the architecture and construction industry.
            </p>
            <p>
              While working on multiple residential and commercial projects, one challenge appeared repeatedly — clients and professionals often struggled to clearly understand the real-time progress of their projects. Updates were scattered across calls, messages, site visits, and informal communication, making it difficult for everyone to stay fully informed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even for architects, interior designers, contractors, and project teams, coordinating updates and maintaining clear communication across different agencies could become complicated and time-consuming.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over time, it became clear that the industry needed a more structured and transparent way to track project progress.
            </p>
            <p className="font-medium" style={{ color: '#f97415' }}>
              APEXIS was created to address this gap.
            </p>
            <p>
              Built with deep insights from architectural practice and real project experience, APEXIS is designed to support architects, interior designers, contractors, developers, and clients throughout the lifecycle of a construction project.
            </p>
            <p>
              APEXIS aims to bring technology-driven clarity, accountability, and organized communication into construction projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              By creating a centralized platform for updates and progress tracking, APEXIS helps ensure that everyone involved in a project — from clients to professionals — stays aligned and informed.
