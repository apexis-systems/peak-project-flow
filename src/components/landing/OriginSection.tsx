              <span className="font-bold" style={{ color: '#111111' }}>APEXIS</span> was born out of years of real-world experience in the architecture and construction industry. Project updates are often scattered across calls, messages, and site visits, making it difficult for clients and professionals to clearly understand real-time progress.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over time, it became clear that the industry needed a more structured and transparent way to track project progress.
            </p>
            <p className="font-bold" style={{ color: '#f97415' }}>
              APEXIS was created to address this gap.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="font-bold" style={{ color: '#111111' }}>APEXIS</span> solves this by providing a centralized platform that helps architects, interior designers, contractors, developers, and clients track project progress and stay aligned throughout the lifecycle of a construction project.
            </p>
            <p>
              By bringing structured communication and technology into construction management, <span className="font-bold" style={{ color: '#111111' }}>APEXIS</span> aims to create greater transparency, clarity, and accountability for everyone involved — from clients to professionals.
